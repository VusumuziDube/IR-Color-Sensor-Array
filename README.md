# IR Colour Sensor Array
By [Vusumuzi Dube](https://github.com/VusumuziDube)

Want to make An IR sensor array for a simple line following robot?
This is the tutorial for you!

## Introduction

This is my journey to create my first IR Sensor array and hopefully it will help you young line follower.

## Requirements

Before beginning let me quickly give the requirements of the sensor so we all know what the end result will be as well as why certain design choices were made.
From the problem description, and compatibility requirements we can discern that 

### Multi-Colour detection

The sensor should be able to distinquish between 4 line colours on a white background, In total the sensor should be able to defrientiate between 5 colours.

### 3.3V Outputs and Operation

Requires 3.3 output and idealy 3.3V input. 5V compatibility is recommended, however it should also work at 3.3V
